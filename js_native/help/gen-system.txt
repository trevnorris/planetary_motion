The structure of the config FILE is an ini file. List of config options are:

[star]
  mass                  mass of the star in kg
  radius                radius of the star in km
  temp                  surface temperature of the star in kelvin
[planet.<name>]
  mass                  mass of the planet in kg
  radius                radius of the planet in km
  albedo                planet's albedo, used to calculate orbit
  bb_temp               planet's black body temperature in celcius, used with
                          albedo to calculate the necessary orbit

Only one star can be provided.
