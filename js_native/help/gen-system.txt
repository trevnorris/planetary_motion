Usage: gen-system [OPTION]...

Generate a star system given the list of OPTIONs.

      --config=FILE     file path to configuration file containing parameters to
                          use when generating the star system
  -h, --help            display this help and exit


The structure of the config FILE is an ini file. List of config options are:

; pass in a type to randomly generate a star
[star]
  type                  for randomly generating a star set the classification,
                          e.g. G0V, K3V

; or pass in the values directly
[star]
  mass                  mass of the star in kg
  radius                radius of the star in km
  temp                  surface temperature of the star in kelvin

; mass and radius are always necessary
[planet.<name>]
  mass                  mass of the planet in kg
  radius                radius of the planet in km

; for a randomly generated planet, only these need to be provided
[planet.<name>]
  albedo                planet's albedo, used to calculate orbit
  bb_temp               planet's black body temperature in celcius, used with
                          albedo to calculate the necessary orbit

; otherwise the keplarian coordinates need to be provided in full. this is the
; output when generating a planet from the above.
[planet.<name>]
    a                   semi-major axis in km
    e                   eccentricity
    i                   inclination in degrees
    w                   argument of periapsis (ω) in degrees
    Om                  longitude of ascending node (ω or Ω) in degrees
    E                   eccentric anomaly < 2π, angle of point P if orbit of
                          P was a circle.
    v                   true anomaly (ν, θ, or f)
    r                   radius; distance from the focus to point P
    h                   angular momentum

Only one star can be provided.
